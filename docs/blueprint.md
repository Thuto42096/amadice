# **App Name**: Dice Dueler

## Core Features:

- Interactive Dice Display: Display a clear, intuitive interface for dice rolling and game status.
- Dice Roll Simulation: Simulate dice rolls with realistic probability.
- Game Logic Engine: Implement standard dice game rules (e.g., Yahtzee, Farkle, etc.) - let the user choose one.
- Customizable Dice: Allow players to choose from different dice types.
- Turn Management: Provide clear scoring and turn-based gameplay.
- Celebration Animation: Incorporate celebratory animations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#388E3C), evoking a sense of classic games and strategy.
- Background color: Light green (#E8F5E9), a very subtle tint of green that contrasts with the primary green and maintains an open and inviting field-of-view.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700), used sparingly for interactive elements and score highlights, suggests triumph.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), which keeps a machined, objective feel, easy-to-read for scores and instructions.
- Use simple, clear icons for game options (e.g., a gear icon for settings). These should generally be in the same hue as the primary, and the same saturation as the background.
- Keep a clean, uncluttered layout. The rolling area should take the focus.
- Subtle animations when dice are rolled, creating visual feedback. Avoid spinning or overly elaborate movements that make the outcome unclear.
